# Arcade Game (Frogger)

## Introduction

This game was made as part of the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree for Project 3. It is based on the classic arcade game Frogger.

## How to Play

Players control the hero character using their keyboard's arrow keys. Up, down, left, and right move the character in those directions on screen. Each press moves the character by one square on screen.

Enemies move horiziontally across the screen. The player must avoid these as they make their way to the top of the screen.

Once the player reaches the top of the screen, they win!
